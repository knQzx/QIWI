# QIWI
Hello everyone! This is a script based on the QIWI API. It contains functions that reduce 
the work of a person. Also, this script can be used to help people who make payments in their, for example, Telegram Bot store.

# QIWI FROM STORE
There is a "QIWI FROM STORE" file here. This script provides you with clean functions for creating payments in your, for example, 
telegram store on python. You will only need your phone number, without the+, and a qiwi token, which you can register here - 
https://qiwi.com/api. For example, you can configure the payment so that in the bot you will give a special generated key, the 
person will send you money, the program reads the information about the payment and if the comment is the same, the program puts 
this money on the bot.
